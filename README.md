# Description
This project is an implementation for an inferencing application using Edge Impulse for audio recognition on an ESP32 microcontroller. Here's a breakdown of the code:

# Hardware Setup:
The project uses the ESP32 microcontroller, specifically handling audio input through the I2S (Inter-IC Sound) interface.
It defines pins for I2S Word Select (I2S_WS), I2S Serial Data (I2S_SD), and I2S Serial Clock (I2S_SCK).
The I2S interface is configured with a specified sample rate (16000 Hz) and other settings.
There are additional pins for a button (BUTTON), an LED (LED_PIN), and some constants like BUZZER_TIMER.

# Audio Sampling and Processing:
The code sets up an I2S interface to read audio data from a PDM (Pulse-Density Modulation) microphone.
The data is processed through an inference pipeline, including a circular buffer for averaging audio samples.
There is a mechanism to handle audio buffer overruns and provide callbacks for data readiness.

# Edge Impulse Inferencing:
The code includes the Edge Impulse inferencing library and sets up structures and functions for audio inferencing.
It initializes the inferencing system, including the inferencing buffers.
The main loop reads audio data, runs continuous inferencing, and prints the results.
Predictions are printed along with timing information for the inferencing process.

# Additional Features:
The code includes some utility functions, such as ei_printf for printing formatted text to the Serial monitor.
The smooth function handles the smoothing of input signals and checks for valid sequences.
There's an averaging function (averageProb) to smooth the output probabilities.
The loop function handles the main execution flow, running inferencing, and controlling LEDs and a buzzer based on the results.

# LED and Buzzer Control:
LED (connected to PIN 27) and a buzzer (connected to PIN 26) are controlled based on the inferencing results.
If the probability of a specific class is high, the LED and buzzer are activated.
There's a timer (b_timer) to control the duration of the buzzer sound.

# Conclusion:
In summary, this code combines the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, I2S audio input, and the Edge Impulse inferencing library to perform continuous audio recognition. The hardware components are controlled based on the inferencing results, allowing for the implementation of an audio-based application with specific responses to recognized patterns or events.
